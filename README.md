# DesktopDatabase
This is a repository to showcase examples of how interact with the Safex.io blockchain using a desktop database

One of the most simplest yet powerful yet complicated desktop databases is Microsoft Access Database. 
It can be configured to do some amazing things, complex things, and automated things. 

It can do almost everything Excel can do, but more, and better. It does have some restrictions, but nothing that really blocks your creativity. 
It does require knowing how all the pieces it together in advance (unlike Excel where you can design and change things on the fly), so it can get challenging when you want to rework a process. 

I'll provide my lice examples of how I get things to work, and those can serve as example for others to experiment with, learn from, and test out. 

Modifying the code in Microsoft Access does require you have the Microosft Office Professional or above license (Access is not useable on the web, it is desktop only)

You can run Microosft Access on all versions of Windows easily.

To run on Macintosh, you will need to install either Paralells, BootCamp, or VirtualBox (or similar) plus a windows license. 
This will run Windows on your mac, and then it can run any Windows program as expected. 
I personally recommend VirtualBox which is Free, and you can turn it on only when needed (downside is it will need roughtly 50GB os storage to have the image ready to launch)
Parralles would be my 2nd choice, though keep in mind, itis paid. 
Plus there is the Mirosoft Windows License you neeed to have (search the web for inexpensive ways to get a Windows License)
